I am a Research Scientist at Amazon Web Services.
I did my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto. I was advised by Professor Raquel Urtasun and Professor Sanja Fidler.
I completed my MS in Toyota Technological Insitute at Chicago (Sept '12 - Dec '13).
I completed my undergraduate studies, B.Tech (Hons.) (July '08 - May '12), at IIIT Hyderabad, India, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I did my Honours project at Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT) lab, under the guidance of Professor P.J. Narayanan.

My research interests lie broadly in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In the last few years, I have been excited about the problem of visual scene understanding. During my PhD, I had explored ideas on how to combine geometric priors and semantic information for 3D scene understanding. At Amazon Go, I have been working towards the goal of building efficient temporal representations across multiple cameras for real-time action detection.
